## Introduction

The mathpackage is an extremely useful package designed for adding and multiplying numeric values. 

## Addition

Addition, commonly denoted as "+", is a mathemtical concept that describes incrementing one value an amount specified by another value.

For example, 

$$1 + 5 = 6.$$

This can be calculated using the `mathpackage` as follows:

```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
devtools::load_all()
```

```{r}
add(1, 5)
```


## Multiplication

The other functionality offered by Math Package is that of multiplication, often denoted "$\times$". I can't be bothered to tell you what multiplication is, so I'll just tell you that

$$ 4 \times 3 = 12$$

This can be calculated using the `mathpackage` as follows:

```{r}
multiply(4, 3)
```

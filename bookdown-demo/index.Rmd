# Introduction

If you want to add or multiple numbers together, then this package is for you!

To install it, you would usually type 

```{r eval = F}
install.packages("mathpackage") ## this won't work as the package isn't on CRAN
```


```{r}
# this will work for now :)
devtools::load_all("../")
```
